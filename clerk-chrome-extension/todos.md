Thoughts
- This is kind of interesting. It has the capacity to be a very interesting and useful app without any additional feature improvements. the key thing is improving the system prompt paragraphs!
- That is so bizarre. 
- That means now if you are an entrepreneur who struggles with closing deals, if you can create the perfect JSON profile for your business and the perfect system prompt. then you can effectively automate it with this software that already exists. 
- in a way, that means the person who spends the effort to edit the paragraph and continue tweaking it should probably see a percentage of the revenues generated right? maybe even most. like the app could in theory be open sourced.
- as it stands, there are one of X ways we can improve the system prompt - do it myself, pay a company a flat-fee, hire a prompt engineer for a salary, are there other models? can you crowdsource the best prompt?
- resources at my disposal: anthropic's prompt improver, DLS?, talk to Ryan & Justin, chatgpt / claude, evals?, can you make a self-improving prompt?
